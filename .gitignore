# Compiled Go binaries
# These are typically placed in the project root or a 'bin' directory
# if 'go build' is run without specifying an output path.
# If you use 'go install' or 'go build -o', adjust accordingly.
# For example, if your binary is named 'myprogram':
# myprogram

# Test executables
# Go test executables are often named with a '.test' suffix
*.test

# Go module cache and build artifacts
# These are typically managed by Go itself and don't need to be committed.
# The 'go.sum' file *should* be committed.
# The 'vendor' directory is optional, depending on module management.
/vendor/
/pkg/
/bin/
/build/

# IDE and editor specific files
# Add any files generated by your IDE or editor that should not be committed.
# Examples:
# .idea/
# .vscode/
# *.sublime-workspace
# *.swp
# *~
